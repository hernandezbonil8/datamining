# Predicting Game Outcomes Using Machine Learning in Sports Analytics

## Overview
This project aims to predict the outcome (win, loss, or draw) of sports matches by analyzing historical game data. The pipeline includes data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and building baseline models (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and K-Nearest Neighbors).

## File Structure
- **README.md:** Project overview and instructions.
- **requirements.txt:** Python package dependencies.
- **eda.py:** Script for loading the CSV dataset, cleaning the data, and performing EDA (plots, summaries).
- **model_training.py:** Script for splitting the data, training baseline models, and evaluating their performance.
- **final_report.tex:** LaTeX source file for the final project report.

## How to Run
1. **Install Dependencies:**  
   Run the following command in your terminal:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
