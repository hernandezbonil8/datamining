# Predicting Game Outcomes Using Machine Learning in Sports Analytics

## Overview
This project uses historical football team statistics (from the 2021â€“2022 season) to predict team performance and to compare two teams head-to-head. We build a machine learning pipeline that includes data exploration, model training using Logistic Regression, and a head-to-head prediction feature. A simple Streamlit app is provided to allow interactive head-to-head predictions.

## File Structure
- **README.md:** Project overview and instructions.
- **requirements.txt:** Python package dependencies.
- **eda.py:** Script for data exploration and visualization.
- **model_training.py:** Script for model training, evaluation, and saving the best model.
- **streamlit_app.py:** A Streamlit app for interactive head-to-head predictions.
- **final_report.tex:** LaTeX source file for the final project report.
- **references.bib:** (Optional) Bibliography for the final report.

## Usage
1. **Install Dependencies:**  
   In your terminal, run:
   ```bash
   python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
